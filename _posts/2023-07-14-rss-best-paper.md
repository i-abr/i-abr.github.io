Congrats to Dayi Dong, Henry Berger, and Ian Abraham for winning the Best Paper Award at the Robotics: Science and Systems Conference in Deagu, South Korea for their work on [Time-Optimal Ergodic Search](https://roboticsconference.org/program/awards/)!

For more information about the work, check out our social media posts [twitter](https://x.com/ianabraha/status/1679828372212584449?s=20) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ian-abraham-58a10684_rss2023-rss2023-activity-7083615298813091840-fWNP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and the [paper](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss19/p082.pdf)! 

TLDR: We derive solutions to the time-optimal ergodic coverage problem which is fundamental to many robotics problems in mapping, exploration, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring!
