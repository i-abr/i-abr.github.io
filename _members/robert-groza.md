Robert is a Yale undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering and pursuing a CS certificate. His interests are in quadruped walking robots and object manipulation. He is currently working on improving manipulation tasks with data-driven reinforcement learning. He is also working on designing and prototyping a quadruped robot to have low-level control over the motors that can result in more agile motion.
