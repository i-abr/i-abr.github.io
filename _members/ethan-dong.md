Cameron Lerch is a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Yale. He earned his B.S. in Physics with minors in Mathematics, Geology, and Philosophy from Missouri University of Science and Technology in May 2019.

As an undergraduate, he researched quantum phase transitions using Monte Carlo simulations with Prof. Thomas Vojta at Missouri S&T. In the summer of 2018, he participated in Yaleâ€™s CRISP Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program, where he performed studies of cyclic shear deformation of bulk metallic glasses with Prof. Corey O'Hern. Cameron was selected as a NSF Graduate Research Fellow in 2019.

His research in the Intelligent Autonomy Lab focuses on control algorithms that utilize simple sensors to search and map an exploration space.
