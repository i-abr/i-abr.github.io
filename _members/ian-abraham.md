Dr. Ian Abraham leads the Intelligent Autonomy lab. He is an Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering at Yale University. Previously he was a postdoc at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University at the Biorobotics Lab. He received the B.S. degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Rutgers University and the M.S. and Ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University at the Center for Robotics and Biosystems. His Ph.D. work focused on developing formal methods at the intersection of robot sensing, control, and active learning. During his Ph.D. he worked at the NVIDIA Seattle Robotics Lab where he worked on robust model-based control for large parameter uncertainty. 

His research interest lies at the intersection of robotics, optimal control, and machine learning with a focus on active sensing and learning. His work has been featured in Robotics Weekly with his student for developing Spot Mini, an open-source, cost-effective quadrupedal robot. He is also the recipient of the 2023 Best Paper Award at the Robotics: Science and Systems conference, the 2019 King-Sun Fu IEEE Transactions on Robotics Best Paper award, and the Northwestern Belytschko Outstanding Research Award for his dissertation.
