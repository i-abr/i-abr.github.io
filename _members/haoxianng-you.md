My name is **Haoxiang You(尤皓翔)**. I am currently a first-year PhD student at **Yale University** working with Professor [Ian Abraham](https://i-abr.github.io/) at **Intelligent Autonomy Lab**. I did my master in the **University of Pennsylvania**. My research interet lies at the intersection of control theory, machine learning and optimization. I hope to contribute to the development of robots that are capable of performinng a wide range of tasks in a safe and efficient manner, and that can be used in a variety of applications.

When I am not at research, I enjoy cooking, DIY and video games.
