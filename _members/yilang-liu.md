I am a second-year PhD student at Yale University's Intelligent Autonomy lab. Before joining the lab, I obtained a dual bachelor's degree from Chongqing University and the University of Cincinnati. After that, I also went to Carnegie Mellon University, where I earned a master's degree, strengthening my foundation in robotics and control systems.

My research at Yale delves deep into quadruped locomotion, whole body control. I want to explore the intersection of traditional control theories and modern machine learning.
