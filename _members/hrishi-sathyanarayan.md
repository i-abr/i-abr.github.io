Hrishikesh "Hrishi" Sathyanarayan is a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Science at Yale University. He recieved his B.S in Aerospace Engineering at Rutgers University in May 2023.

Prior to working at the Intelligent Autonomy Lab, he worked as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Jingang Yi's Robotics, Automation, and Mechatronics (RAM) Laboratory. His work at Rutgers focused on experimental studies on aircraft tire-runway interactions, mechanical design, and control methods for underactuated robots. Currently, he is interested in understanding how the behavior of mechanisms in robotic systems effect the broader scope of higher-level active learning problems.
